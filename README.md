### Introduction

Users will have to sign up or login to create their own profile. From their profile they have the ability to edit their profile and delete it. Users also have the ability to create their own characters from the profile. Upon creation of a character users are redirected to the character show page. Here the character can be edited and also deleted. As characters are created, they also appear in the user profile with a link to the show page. When viewing all characters, all characters that have been created can be viewed. Users have the ability to filter results by race. Upon viewing a character that the user has not created they can leave comments and a rating. Users cannot comment on their own character. 

Users are able to join and create chatrooms. If a chatroom is public every user has the ability to send and recieve live messages. User can create private rooms in two ways. They can select other users that they want to join the chat, they need to include themselves if they wish to be in the chat. The other way to make a chat is by race. If a user has a character of the same race as a chat they have access and can send and recieve messages. Private chats can be deleted at any time from within the chatroom, public chats cannot be deleted.
